# Face Mask Detector Model 

## Overview
This README provides an overview of a Face Mask Detector Model project. The project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision and deep learning techniques. Face mask detection models like this can be used to ensure compliance with mask-wearing policies in public spaces.

## Project Structure
The project consists of several main components:
1. **Data Collection:** A dataset of images containing people with and without face masks is collected or curated. This dataset is essential for training the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The collected images are preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare them for model training.

3. **Model Training:** A deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn to classify images into two classes: "with mask" and "without mask."

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.

5. **Deployment:** If applicable, the trained model can be deployed as part of a real-time face mask detection system, which can be used in public spaces or other relevant applications.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries and frameworks are used in this project:
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning)
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (for model evaluation)
- Flask (for web-based deployment, if applicable)
